# Sparse_Matrix
This project, "Sparse Matrices and Their Applications," explores the efficient storage and manipulation of sparse matrices, which are matrices predominantly composed of zero elements. Sparse matrices are vital in various fields, including machine learning, computer graphics, scientific computing, and telecommunications, as they significantly reduce computational and memory overhead. The project includes implementations in both C++ and Python, demonstrating basic operations like creation, display, and addition of sparse matrices. It also provides visual representations to illustrate their practical use in managing large-scale, sparse data sets, making it an essential resource for handling large, sparse systems efficiently.
